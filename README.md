# duel.io
Verse a friend in this online top-down shooter made with node.js and socket.io.
Create a match and send your friend your room code. When they enter it they'll join
your room and the game starts from there. First to 5 wins! 

Frontend is deployed to Netlify and the backend deploys to Heroku. The default socket can be changed to 
localhost3000 for testing.

The game can be accessed [here!](https://duelio.netlify.app/) 
(Press the restart button 'R' when you first join a game or else P2 wont be able to shoot.. fix in progress!)
